# learning-flask
Simple Projects to learn Flask along with some other goodies.


In this repository there will be many stages of me learning flask. It will start with writting a basic webserver in python and then progress towards using flask as a template of choice and then adding additional features and finally a final project demonstrated in another git repository.
